# Speede Game Pro

A simple clicker game that tests your speed and reflexes.

## Description

_An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use._
Speede Game Pro is a game for our Ohjelmistoprojekti 1 course. The game is based on an old game called Nopeustesti, that was known from an old Finnish TV show called Speden Spelit. In our game the classic mode is closest to the original. In classic mode the objective is to collect as many points as possible without running out of time or pressing the wrong button. Also to add difficulty, the time that the player has between button presses gets shorter every 10 points. The other game mode we added is a time attack mode, where in 30 seconds the player has to get as many correct button presses as possible. For each correct press you gain one point and for each wrong press you lose one point. The games is playable on web browser and mobile.
